# Connect via SQL Shell

In TiDB Cloud SQL Shell, you can try TiDB SQL, test out TiDB's compatibility with MySQL quickly, and administer database user privileges.

> **Note:**
>
> You cannot connect to [TiDB Serverless clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) using SQL Shell. To connect to your TiDB Serverless cluster, see [Connect to TiDB Serverless clusters](/tidb-cloud/connect-to-tidb-cluster-serverless.md).

To connect to your TiDB cluster using SQL shell, perform the following steps:

1. On the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, click the name of your target TiDB cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Go to **Network** in the left navigation pane, click **Open SQL Shell** on the upper-right corner .

3. On the prompted **Enter password** line, enter the root password of the current cluster. Then your application is connected to the TiDB cluster.
